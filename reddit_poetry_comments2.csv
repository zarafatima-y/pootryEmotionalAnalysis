1nuoshd,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nuoshd/help_me_pleaseee/,Rorqual_Zen,"Lots of really great language, but this is a doozy to address really. I'm not opposed to delving way into it, but considering that it's your spoken word presentation idea, I suppose you're looking for either shallow or very particular kinds of feedback that aren't focused on how you may need to develop as a poet later on. That can be difficult, but perhaps interestingly, whether or not this is a good poem to use in a spoken word contest has gotta depend on how old you are + the type of contest. That might sound odd, however the presentation of art is everything, and full context in that situation is \* critical \*. I'll explain.

I know there's pretty much no way you're in middle school, but say if you were, this would be a totally outstanding poem to consider reading, and everything would depend on your execution (actual confident reading, like actors do on stage basically). In middle school, people aren't usually capable of writing artsy stuff like this, and it doesn't matter when certain aspects may be 'over the top' from an adult's perspective. In other words just the fact that you're writing like this will be impressive and cool to everyone unless you are not even slightly confident, because then it can seem like a 'try hard' thing.

Alright, so then we'd have high school where the crowd will be divided to some degree, and your execution reading out loud would simply matter a little more. For example, you could purposefully sound grand, fancy and colorful like a Shakespeare actor, partially making a joke out of how words like ""befall"" will sound, and I can imagine a few ways where good-to-great performance can make you a serious contender. Anywhere above high school level however, this won't really fly the way it is, because adults will expect structural refinement + sensitivity to how things will sound socioculturaly, phonetically and so on. Like, a room full of 18 year olds should have a pretty good sense for it, even if they have no idea why, but I could be giving them too much credit, bumping my point over somewhere between 18 and 24 maybe.

If you're an adult and thinking about doing this at a local poetry slam where the competition will be normal or good as a matter of curation, then my usual style of critique would probably come into play, because it'd be directed at your presented/apparent skill level and ways to help you improve in new poetry writing attempts over time. Lines like ""In the comfort befalling at dusk, it begins"" are flippin' sweet for a middle school student to bring up and try executing, but I think something like ""In the comfort of dusk it begins"" would be better \* shrugs \* The word befalling is kind of a stretch, especially because it's rather elevated formal language, setting a tone that can be hard to follow up.

The next thing to me is phonetic tone, because ""crickets speak"" would be difficult to say out loud well for many people. I won't carry on because I'm not sure it's relevant, and what I've said so far looks like quite a bit of potentially useful framework.",1,2025-09-30 22:37
1nuoshd,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nuoshd/help_me_pleaseee/,Confident-Till8952,"Some of the use of language and phonetics is interesting. At times, it comes across as “trying to sound poetic” when regular (closer to actual thoughts or speaking voice) grammar could be used.

However, I don’t want to discourage linguistic constructions.

I think a comma is due after this line

during these curtain fallen hours,

This allows this line to be packaged as one idea. The “curtain-fallen hours” being the focus.

I lay,

i sense the cold, unfeeling, and brief this breeze, like a ghostly touch trace up my thigh and caress my grief

So whats the significance of these references to anatomy?

The portrayal of this sequence through anatomy seems like a sexually charged gaze. Even if its of low intensity.

Also why grief?

Why is a cold wind caressing up a thigh?

Why are the linens breaking?

Also why is the “up-thigh” so warm by contrast?

Tbh, I’m not saying this is true, but it comes across as the use of sensuality for the purpose of gaining edge.

As apposed to building atmosphere.

But the use of “brief” as a verb is pretty cool.

(I would omit the preceding “and”)

The line itself, is a little questionable 

Also herein lies… a decent opportunity to build upon themes of primordial energies, biology, nature, growth…

Is there a gender to this mc? 

womanhood… maybe?

to cocoon with linens breaking at the seams brewing myself in the warmth of me

(Of me, I think is one if these unnecessary poeticisms)

(Just warmth, I think lands well)

as the ocean reaches for the moon, await for dawn for the sun is set to return and crickets retire to sleep

I do see some rhythm here. Some phonetic cadence. 

This sort of relaxed, serene, whimsy… 

Cadence uniting with theme + atmosphere is a good idea… 

However, it’s a little confusing. 

So you leave the original scene. Which, seems to have themes of domesticity.

In order to transition To the ocean.

So AWAIT for dawn.

Feels like a beckon to the audience, no?

Perhaps, AWAITING the dawn… keeps the ocean as the subject. Some continuity with the personification of nature. “The ocean reaching.”

So this is where it gets a bit more confusing

await for dawn for the sun is set to return and crickets retire to sleep

So the ocean waves.. are awaiting dawn… then awaits sun set….

So “return” feels a little redundant here.

Crickets retire to sleep.

Whats the significance of “retire” here?

Also why are the waves reaching towards the moon?

Its a little confusing because here we have ocean waves… waiting not just for dawn, but for another sunset, then a random closing line about crickets going to sleep… so essentially a waiting sequence that lasts a whole 24 hrs…

Why? Why is the ocean in a perpetual state of waiting for something that already is happening?

The ocean waits for sunset, then dawn…

Is this an intentional metaphor for something? Is the confusion intentional?

Basically you have these things built around a paradoxical waiting of the ocean..

Ocean waves, the moon, dawn, then sunset, crickets go to sleep

It just doesn’t feel quite intentional or meaningful yet.

but alas, the daybreak brings about not salvation as a lone cymbal awakes and cicadas sing

(But, alas? Feels like another “poeticism”) (Brings about not…)

So FINALLY.. the daybreak doesn’t bring salvation…..

Ok.. here we are at daybreak ALAS… after all this waiting… but no salvation here… ok

So the long awaited non salvation serving daybreak is akin to a solo cymbal bring played, which wakes up crickets?

Or rather the emanation of the cymbal is what happens next. 

So why are cicadas a counterpart to crickets? 

What do you feel this represents? 

From cold air, up thigh, grief, cold-warm, night time currents drawn, bed time, crickets going to sleep

To 

A solo cymbal note, cicadas, daybreak, no salvation

Please, explain to me.

What are you trying to say? What are the themes? What are the meanings of this piece?

If you write these things down, in plain English. Perhaps you could explore another way of constructing it.

What I gather is…

Someone who waits for the next best thing and cannot appreciate the present moment or what already is.

Time passes them by, as they keep looking forward in a paradox of continual discontent.

Overlooking beauty. Pertaining to simple circadian rhythms and self care.

Then how does this tie back into the invasive cold air caresses a person’s grieving private parts?

Is it like the person is trying to invite some shocking truth, through self reflection, on how to move forward after a traumatic event?

Why the lone cymbal?

I think with some more distinguished intentions, and different grammar particles.. this could come together in a beautiful way.

Meaning with more clarity, but not at the expense of atmosphere. Or dream-like ambiguity, if thats what you want.

But, most importantly, what do you think? What were your intentions?

Edit: I may have read that wrong.

The sun is set to return. Is another depiction of dawn/day break.

In this case the emotionality I get, from first read,

Is like an atmosphere of continual grief. A state of mind, that alters from day to night. But essentially cannot be easily shaken. Or just reoccurs.

This person goes through the natural and casual mood swings day to day. But all within this world of gnawing discontent. Where bliss, euphoria, and appreciation of simple beauties and domestic comforts is the bandaid or escape. 

Also… I try to schedule time to speak to you. 

But, I also take breaks from literature. Some space and time away from the work, helps me to realize things I was missing. 

I will work on something, take break. Maybe just do absolutely nothing. Somewhere between meditation and nap. 

Haha just see how restful I can get my body to be. 

Or I go for a walk. 

Its like

Literature, rest, literature, rest…walk, literature… relax… sleep",1,2025-09-30 22:55

1nubtfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nubtfv/can_you_make_her_stay/,Rorqual_Zen,"Good exploration, good context, great theme. Umm, not a lot else jumps out, which can sometimes be a 'me problem' when I'm addressing rhyming poetry. After your lines

But you stare into those eyes,  
and realise then and there,  
The damage is done,

I was thinking a rhyme is about to kinda swing in and shift the context explanation phase here, and it did, which isn't exactly bad it just appears a tad silly when there's momentum involved explaining something that sounds pretty charged. And I mean, sure it does add a little more context (much beyond repair), but you can probably see my point about artistic presentation dropping in quality somewhat only to land the rhyme.

Now I'm not suggesting you aren't already aware of this, so quite possibly you felt limited by a self-imposed need to rhyme; the thing is, I don't think there is a trick to avoiding the problem, rhyming is just kinda weird/particular to try doing, because you have to mull over options constantly. If you like it, I hope that's a good 'case in point' example of how things can go awry and dilute the possibility of an evocative, charged climax to your poem. If you aren't sure, I would highly recommend choosing not to rhyme in the future whenever you may be into that.

I think line 16 is where I figured well, that's cool/interesting language, but maybe rather clunky with ""remains"" + ""panes"" rhyming execution. I know that this kind of thing is subjective in a number of cases - like, who might feel like their thought process just tripped over a rhyme, and who might not. I would suggest practical objectivity (kinda statistically speaking) is always something to consider. Especially since you are obviously roughly the opposite of a Postmodernist. This poem is very formal and rigid compared to loads and loads of Postmodern styles you might choose from, create, and hybridize with others, so... I think pointing these things out is my best feedback.",1,2025-09-30 22:06

Sometimes, my mind does stumble upon rhymes which sound good, fit the context, and add something. But oftentimes I find myself searching for rhymes before even deciding what I want to write. So its almost like I'm basing my poems on the rhymes rather than vice versa. My mind has started associating poetry with rhyming, rather than actual exploration of an emotion or feeling. So yeah I will be doing something to change that. Thanks for the feedback!

A waning truth in the distance.  
This once was a sweet monotony -  
Gardens of beauty,  
For I remember a callow child tugging  
at me,  
Inviting me to revel in it’s arbour.



The shadows whose peripheries  
I had so vehemently traced  
as bearers of shame, of obscurity,  
Portents murmuring in the dark -  
Groaning in a maimed past,  
but you adorned them. You were  
rapturous, and so I was incandescent.

We talked of those whose bones we had  
worn, under dwindling sunsets,  
And parts of us that had atrophied,  
I waned until I befitted the reflection in your eyes.

But these are mere glimpses now,  
A clandestine pirouette on your  
rings of light,  
A silence like the awaiting of the night.  
Now I see that guileless child  
Pass me by like an omen;

But I am in the arbour of love.  
For you had beckoned me-  
To be the tenet of your night-  
I have just come in the form of my waning life.  
Just to listen to you whisper,  
To hear the remnants of our past,  
O but for the doleful silence -  
The ceaseless silence on the morrow.

That’s why’s it’s so profound and as another comment said “rigid and formal”. It’s because when you’re writing the words, you’re writing with so much passion and emotion. That’s what I love about poetry, that even though it can be messy at times, it’s still so profound. 

But what I find myself, that what I’m writing is powered by such strong feeling, you continue to just write whatever you’re thinking . So without thought you just express what you feel, then it can come across like it’s lacking organisation.

That also depends on the kind of abstract poetry, as well as the kind of painter you are (hence your bodies of work practically interacting).

I think the minimalism really works here, you accomplish a lot of characterisation in the few details you choose to include and you create a really tender moment between the narrator and the person they're addressing.

I don't know Shakespeare super well, so is this referencing an actual play or did you make up the details? If it's the first is the specific play significant to your story, like are you trying to say something about how the narrator met their partner in the plot points that happen in the play? If so I think there's some fun potential to build on that.

I therefore like to be overt about my awareness of these potential factors. Now I do not necessarily intend to disagree with GoodGirlsStand in this situation, however my opinion is that helping to make sure you understand what it is you're doing may be a lot more useful than saying this poem is very good/great generally speaking; and ideally what I just said will make crystal clear sense.

Sparse lines that 'do a lot' are generally quite nice in poetry, and relatively rare, but it depends on what kind of style/person. For example, intensely abstract poets I've noticed may tend to do it more often as a specific (intended or subconscious) attempt to add space or flow. With that being said, if we look at your first few lines without breaks, it should be very clear that the wording is letter-like 'plain language' (prose):

""Remember when we went to watch that play performed outdoors - and we'd made a point of reading up on Wikipedia what it was about. Because what we knew would happen - happened.""

Punctuation is fair enough, especially with line breaks, so I like it btw. I would say my point is going to be rather obvious to many readers in the beginning, and somewhere around your line ""was due to marry"", there's a bit of charge + perceived intentionality to the line breaks, which I don't exactly love personally, but it is very good as the poem goes on - especially as the end appears, which is why I don't mean to particularly disagree. I would say, by the line ""But we laughed"", what is being presented as a poem becomes much more poetic than before, leaning into theme exploration I call 'salt of the earth', with excellent development direction toward (and into) both 'reverie' and 'love'. Absolutely great for a beginner, and I'd comfortably say it can be supported into much higher quality if you were to write more like this later on (for all I know, you do).

A fair amount of why I decided to write this also relates to Vesurel's comment, because while all feedback is 100% fair and worth considering, hopefully you might understand why I consider the story-related details they brought up much less important than forms of artistic execution. Yes, those are examples of options they mentioned, and I know there are a lot of people who want to expand on story context within their own poem to the point of consciously being plain/simple/happy all the while. Fair enough, there is simply something to be said about an element of evocative charge within poetry that can be noticed at the end of your poem by stark contrast to the beginning.",1,2025-09-30 21:22

That said, it does read a bit like something you’d find in a holiday card, more in the style of the traditional “roses are red, violets are blue” poems. If that’s what you were going for, then it works perfectly!

If you wanted to develop the language and metaphors further, you could try rewriting another version while keeping the same premise, and see if you can dig a little deeper than the surface level.

I'm a very abstract poet and any time I see a significant intensity of abstract associations I'm glad to see that just on its own; unless of course that goes so far it can't reasonably make sense.

I feel a slight disconnect between the two stanzas though, there is a struggle for sleep, then a struggle with unrequited love. It either needs only one theme, or more depth to capture both effectively. 

1. go into the struggles of insomnia, what is it you want to capture with this issue

2. explore how insomnia and thoughts and love are intertwined more deeply

eg. something like: at night I often think of you... while counting seams of dark, I recount themes of us, laughing till our ribs hurt, my mind echoes the longing of my heart for its love, to sleep

eg. into hazy black... imagine the dreams I could have, my thoughts like ribbons wrapped around sheep, or strung together with colours to make them lull me to sleep... and maybe, I could escape this hell

I think it has more to do with my selection of title perhaps? The poem isn't about insomnia - at least not the medical kind. The focus is meant to be more on the reflection about love - set in the scene of laying awake at night because you are going through those thoughts in your head. 

The title of insomnia was meant to enhance that perspective of thoughts/regrets etc that keep us up at night (like insomnia) as opposed to a focus on actual insomnia or the struggle of sleeping - a more succinct way of titling the poem ""thoughts that keep me up at night"". not sure if that makes a difference for you or not, I may still need more crossover between the two stanzas.",1,2025-10-01 14:21

You had a very good thematic element in mind there (presented at the end), and I'm recalling how one of my favorite Sci Fi novels was written in a way that seems to have been entirely inspired by the concept 'choose again'. Something about this fact that we can choose... deserves more attention from artists of all kinds. Anyway, to sort of ground what I just said into your execution now, this poem is something like 'pretty good for a beginner' except your thematic development is still quite awesome. Loads of intermediate poets do not really do \* anything \* except explore some thought about their past, or describe a situation plainly, so I'm always glad to see directional momentum in thematic development handled well itself. Usually that shows potential. Otherwise, my suggestion for poems like this is to keep on writing similar stuff, maybe in different styles, but this one is great.",2,2025-10-01 23:07

I like how the repeated question pulls the reader back into the theme. The line about burning it all “for something pure” really stands out. The middle feels a bit vague though with words like “life and lust and being.” More concrete imagery there could make the ending’s soft “let’s try again” land even stronger.,2,2025-10-02 2:07

The swings between sorrow and longing, to moments of anger ""too fucking much"" is quite evocative of the undulations of a breaking heart. I also don't mind a little self referential moment, reminding the reader that we're reading a poem, a piece of art written by a real person, it feels grounding while also a source of identification.

  
My critique is that i find some of the rhymes a bit forceful; the way the previous lines are structured makes me sort of anticipate what's going to be said next, if that makes sense. I think that a bit more imagery could be added amongst the affect too, like a description of 'deep depression', what that feels specifically to the writer would hit harder than the more clinical language I think.

You explore the metaphor in detail and take it to its logical conclusion, which is hard to do in a satisfying way. Nice work! I really like “she threw her waist down the stairs.” It’s unexpected. It actually reminded me a little of language poetry, like Gertrude Stein? I’m also getting Plath, like Lady Lazarus.

Anyway, I think this is nearly done! I do think the title could be improved— it’s clever, but that’s all it is. Something weirder maybe?

The last part has a little grammatical ambiguity. “She had forgotten how to fit// a mound of bolts, joists and nails” into what? The next line is “here the woman lies etc” which would seem to be a new thought. Edit for clarity is all I’m saying :)

Contentwise, this really resonated with me. “Here the woman lies/ not quite fixed.” Never quite fixed, eh? After all that work one is still in a heap.

The word contrived here. 

It implies this “dreamy gaze” is false, in some way.

Maybe someone trying to accomplish an ethereal mood, by making a face… but not quite entering the bliss.

It looks like you structured and executed this about as well as possible considering what the intended thematic exploration must have been. At first I thought you were going to refer to aspects of one person's psyche/character/life, and then when both Mother and Father appeared I thought that must not be the case, and then by the end it looked like you did mean something like ""We can all be kinda mothering sometimes, you know?"", which is a bit of a stretch, just not all the way. For example, the term Fathering isn't always a viable term regarding behavior because Mothers do the same thing, and are they now fathering, just because the Father can Mother through their behavior? Or is Fathering a biological reproductive role? See my point?

1nuh9l9,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nuh9l9/the_golden_appartment_by_jeanne_vessantra/,Rorqual_Zen,"Not bad. A lot of this is artful and creative. Good theme exploration and development through 'longing', 'loss', and maybe touches of 'reverie', but there's a lot of stylistic shifting into letter-like plain language and lines that read more like thinking about the poetic theme through your finger tips than you may prefer over time. I'd say it's pretty much impossible to make a style out of that, but obviously after Postmodern realizations we've had in the West, you can try just about anything as long as it doesn't fully break down into prose or simply bore the heck out of your intended audience.

It's worth noting that the intended audience can (and will for most people while they learn) be literally no one, which I'd suggest is where intensely significant progress can be made regarding artistic refinement. In this case I'd imagine either a person you were writing about may be the intended audience, or of course you may have been simply modeling your thoughts in relation to a fictitious person. Usually, when you're writing poetry for a person, so much of what you write becomes charged with stuff you intend them to hear like the meaning 'packs a punch' in some way, which is very much the opposite of generalized artistic depth that people might approach as complete strangers.

I say all of this because some lines in here I do like, I simply had to kinda treat this like there are multiple poems that mixed together in stylistic presentation for one reason or another. From my perspective, the best lines begin with:

Here, inside the Golden Apartment, countless things remain unsaid.  
Words fall out through the large windows into movie-like streets,  
chasing the childish shadow of a man — his shadow.  
My elbows ache against the stone-hard sill;

Now that is one heck of a switcheroo compared to many of your other lines like:

Because you are my soul, and I cannot ignore  
the greatness of the power you hold.  
I love you, but you are not here.  
I would love if you could see  
how this world turns without your will,  
how every time you scream, I sting,  
how I am alone even when you do not leave.

See my point? I could get into the weeds and pick apart many more differences whether or not they may be as stark as my examples, but suffice it to say that my first example of lines in your poem have much more of an evocative charge to them. With that being said, it's also worth noting that a lot of poets overtly prefer being plain/simple/happy, like those folks who rhyme in strict format about stuff that happened in their lives (like just recalling events lol). Everyone can do their own thing, but your title is Golden Apartment, and when you finally mentioned it directly your poem dropped into what I consider a far better poetic style that could simply be developed, allowing the whole poem to become much shorter in a targeted/refined manner.",2,2025-09-30 20:25

1nud0jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nud0jf/pilgrim/,Vesurel,"This is fun and I like the story. The one question I'd have is why you went with an AA BB CC... rhyme scheme? Do you have a specific artistic or aesthetic purpose to using one. Something I see new poets do a lot is write to a rhyme scheme out of a sense that that's what poetry should do. If that's why you choose to I'd suggest trying this again without worrying about having your rhymes in the same place each time.

As an example

\&gt;A future shines bright in its reflection.  
\&gt;I steer my boat in that direction.

Both of these are lines are fine on their own, but in a poem where every pair of lines follows the same pattern they can blend in with the rest. And there's a risk that you'll end up contorting your sentences into uncomfortable orders just so the right words come at the right times. Or writing lines you don't need narratively just to have a rhyme.  You can trust your audience to notice rhymes even if they aren't always at the end. For example,

\&gt;A future shines bright in it's reflection  
\&gt;That's the direction I steer my boat

That's an alternative order (not saying it's better) that still keeps the repeated sounds but doesn't conform to your pattern as rigidly. The reader will still notice what you did there, and this way they'll know they can't always expect rhymes in the same place, meaning there less likely to be distracted guessing what's next. The worst thing that can happen is the reader coming up with better lines while they're reading and a regular pattern makes that easier for them to do. That's why being surprising helps, surprises show the audience you know this story better than them.

As a side not something about 'in that direction' feels vague to me, you've already said what you have to say about that direction in the previous line so referring back to it without adding anything new feels off somehow. 

In summary, I'd go line by line and ask 'what does this add to my poem?' and 'does this work best as AA BB etc?'. If I'm right (and that's a big if) you could find that you get more done more smoothly with a more free verse style. If you do decide that the rigid format is for you, then that's valid too, but then you've got to try really hard to keep your word choices impactful and surprising when the audience know what's coming structurally.  You do this well with you last two lines, swim and pilgrim is a novel rhyme and it's a nice 'punchline' at the end. The contrast between the two images works well as a surprise (similarly with cotton and rotten), whereas in most other cases the ideas you rhyme with each other are complimentary. Like rhyming  tethered and weathered.
