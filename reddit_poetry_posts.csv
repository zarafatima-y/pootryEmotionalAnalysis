1nuvypg,Goodbye,Kat_Stratford_,"A year ago I disappeared 

I vanished from your sight

No one knows that I'm not here

My dear, I hoped you might



I just want one goodbyes for me

And then I'll leave, I'll be set free

But no one thinks, or cares to know

To let a spirit like me go

I quit smoking more than six years ago,  
Some would call it a milestone.

  
Now I am in Sicily  
Been to Palermo, now in Catania.  
I am strolling through its streets alone,  
Holding my hands in pockets as they feel empty.  
I came across this Korean bar, similar to one we have been to together.  
I order soju.  
  
But it tastes different.  
Maybe because I drink it with beer,  
Maybe it's the cigarette.

in the comfort befalling at dusk, it begins
tamed summer heat and crickets speak
a disturbance may be, their symphony
yet in the middle of the city, crickets sing

during these curtain fallen hours i lay
i sense the cold, unfeeling, and brief
this breeze, like a ghostly touch
trace up my thigh and caress my grief

to cocoon with linens breaking at the seams
brewing myself in the warmth of me

as the ocean reaches for the moon, await for dawn
for the sun is set to return and crickets retire to sleep

but alas, the daybreak brings about not salvation
as a lone cymbal awakes and cicadas sing",7,6,1,2025-09-30 20:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nuoshd/help_me_pleaseee/

A smile that stirs and warms to life,
The boy I left behind.


Her blazing hair, a supernova burns,
Like Polaris on a starless night,
To guide a boy who's lost his way, and yearns to see the light.


In her eyes like honey waits a vision pure and true,
An open door, a welcome home,
For a boy who's rest is due.


Her voice is Riesling sweet, a young and ageless refrain,
It whispers, shouts and calls the dawn,
For a boy who runs again.


As I close me eyes, I see her there, and gently drift to sleep,
And when I wake she's with me still,
A girl my dreams will keep.

1nvpwo5,I should have,CryptographerHot1736,"By Nekro

I wrote no letter,  
though my hands knew the shape of your name.  
I never called,  
though my voice ached like an unused chord.  
Every silence was a decision disguised as a wound,  
and now the wound has built a kingdom.

You were not a shadow,  
not an echo,  
but the axis around which my days turned.  
The kind of presence that warms a room
just by imagining it.  
The kind of nearness  
that teaches a man what it means to be whole.

I kept thinking there would be time,  
time to speak,  
time to explain,  
time to be more than the dark gravity around you.  
But I traded every moment for another unfinished thought,  
and now the hours rise like black water.

My solitude is not stoic.  
It is a cathedral of regret.  
where every arch curves toward the memory of your hands.  
I walk it barefoot,  
your absence pressed into the stone. 
like a prayer you never heard me say.

And if you read this,  
if the words pull at you like a tide,  
know this  
I have built this house from my mistakes.  
Every beam is an apology.  
Every window is a moment I should have reached for you.

I did not call.  
I did not write.  
I stood outside the door of my own heart  
while you waited,  
and the waiting became an ocean.

Now I am adrift  
in a ritual of false comfort,  
nostalgia sharpened until it tastes like hunger.  
I drink it because it is the only thing  
that still feels like you.

If these lines tremble as you read them,  
it is because my pulse is inside them.  
If your breath falters,  
it is because the weight is real.  
This is not performance.  
This is the architecture of my longing.

You were, and are,  
the love of my life.  
The still point of my storm.  
The design I could never build,  
the heartbeat I keep losing in my own noise.

I should have done more.  
I should have reached out.  
I should have broken my own silence  
before it became my language.

And now, here you are,  
not as a ghost,  
but as the tremor that lives in my hands  
when I write you into existence.

If you feel it,  
the ache, the warmth, the ruin,  
then I have built it well.  
Then you are standing in my cathedral.  
Then you are reading  
what I always meant for you to find.",2,5,1,2025-10-02 0:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nvpwo5/i_should_have/
1nv2qri,Drowning,chowxian,"I didn’t drown so much this time.  
Not so sure that’s a good thing.  
It’s been quiet so long  
I forgot how to swim,  
or even float.  

When I left that town  
I wasn’t prepared  
for how quiet the world would become.  

All the sounds you made  
the rhythms,  
how I expected a certain note  
at a certain time of day:  
your sigh, your giggle,  
the way you spoke in your language.  

And then suddenly,  
the season had to end.  
And just silence  
sharp as a saber  
ending a melody.  

Since then,  
each moment has been about  
filling that silence:  
returning to my work,  
obligations and responsibilities,  
drinking until closing,  
ignoring the fact that it’s wrong.  

Is this how I’m meant to fill it?  

When you were once  
the shore where I resign,  
now the thoughts of you  
become the storm of my demise.  ",2,5,1,2025-10-01 8:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nv2qri/drowning/

I still whisper softly, calling your name.
Our hands once locked, our souls aligned,
I was yours, and you were mine.

Your eyes kept me breathing, they held me near,
Your warmth was the light that chased off fear.
Your smile, our laughter, the nights we stayed,
Our bodies together, where memories are made.

The years go by, but I still chase,
Your eyes, your laugh, your endless grace.
I search the crowd, I reach the air,
But turn my head—no one is there.

Why did it end? Why slip away?
A piece of my soul still longs each day.
I claim I’ve moved on, but deep inside,
The love I felt then has never died.

That lingering gaze

Those autumn walks,
arm in arm,
heart by heart,
laughing together,
smiling together—

didn’t mean to you
what they did to me.

So
you chose her.

Her brown eyes
outshone my blue.
Her laugh
was the loudest in the room.
Her presence consumed you,
your yellow glow.

Then you lost us both,

none of it mattered.

Two hearts,
broken.
Two souls,
lost.

The Rock has been in thousands of interviews I reckon

I’d give him the best one of his life

Asking him hard hitting questions 

...

Does he listen to podcasts?

Does he avoid fruit on weekdays?

Does he memorise lines before he goes to bed?

Does he understand the inner workings of a Toyota Corolla?

Does he read encyclopedias about rocks to understand his own kind? 

Does he laugh when little children walk by with ice cream on their faces?

...

I wonder if he would think that I ask the best questions 

Questions that he would make him ponder 

What is his place in this world of ours?

As the fella in the movies 

As a lump of muscle 

...

If I interviewed the Rock I know I would change his life 

As the cameras roll for GQ, Ladbible and [Joe.ie](http://Joe.ie)

I would ask him for a selfie 

Tell him “for the kids”

Boyishly winking

I would ask him for a smile 

And to open another button on his shirt 

He would  gawk at me

At the moment of taking the photo 

I would ask him

""Do you love me?""

He would answer 

¨I love everyone, I´m the Rock¨ 

I would tell him 

¨I love you too Mister Dwayne the Rock Johnson¨

Addressing him by his god given name 

...

He would snap out of the deluge fuge state of being the Rock 

He would know that I am different from the others 

His interview would stamp its place in his mind 

He would remember me as the man who asked him odd questions

Told him that he loved him 

Addressing him by his name

...

Maybe one day 

While looking at a child with Ice Cream on their face 

Passenger seat of a Toyota Corolla

Encyclopedia at hand  

Page pressed to sediment formations

The Rock will think of me.

Also I apolgise in advance because  I’m not great at following a structure in poetry- I just write how I feel. Please give me any criticism on this poem (especially on structure and form). :)

I’ve always felt this overwhelming urge, that I need to put this connection into words.
In years that I’ve known you, you’ve made me learn, 
That I’m worthy of love even when I’m hurt.

You’re more than a friend who’s been there on my darkest days,
Even when I’m feeling down, because of you I’ll be okay.

To me you’re a light that shines so bright,
You lift me up when I start to lose sight.

You’re always there to pick me up, even when I’m being a cunt.
You know about how I express my love, even when it’s tough.

So I hope throughout my life that you will stay,
I love when we just sit here smoking through the day.

You’re the friend that I go to when I need some intellect,
I find comfort in knowing that with you I can connect.",0,3,1,2025-10-01 0:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nutd97/poem_for_my_best_friend/

rise to meet me.  
And oh, bad darling,


let me force you back  
down. A woman’s


games are sacred  
like my heart.

1nvbefz,When our fingers intertwined,lawandkurd,"When our fingers intertwined,
you resembled an image of beauty.
This time you longed for something else.
This time, we were both caught entirely in a stormy state.

In a horizon of deep indigo,
the violet star was wholly sorrowful, fragile, and weary.
You said your lips tremble as they scatter colors of light
upon your tender words.

You said that this time you are more ardent
in the feeling of love—
for the journey of imagination,
for being completely close.

I myself was entirely lost in your eyes.
I long to pour cold water upon myself,
as if to awaken.
I returned from my own wandering.

Your eyes fit me so well—
they are the map of my life.
I whispered back:
“O vendor of charms, how is it that you are so fervent,
like the boiling and rushing waters,
while we await the snowfall of day?”

We wait for lessons to pass easily,
without being given to suffering,
because it is frightening,
when wings are pulled down
upon the burdened weight of our lives.
That’s just how it is.

2.
At that moment when it is in our grasp,
it strikes us like blood.

3.
My hands dance,
like a gazelle filled with delight.
My whole body advances step by step with patience,
through the hardness of the pebbles.

Chatting taints it all—
and somehow, it hurts.

1nvhy60,Down and Low,Fast-Pattern5041,"
- When you're down and low, the crumbs look like boulders.
You get disorganized, don't even put you precious things in folders.
Your life becomes a clutter
You live in the dark, you even close the shutters,
You don't socialize, but when you do, you get occasionally let out a stutter.
It's the anxiety built up in you, but mostly the comfort...
Your apartment, room or house or mansion,
Becomes your resort.
Your emotions go up and down like a chairlift.
You start to look into  yourself finally and see the soul you have.
God's gift...

And I almost didn't answer it
I checked my phone and it's 1:35 in the morning

 I can't help but wonder why you're calling 
Knowing that you hate phone calls 
But I remember that you were quiet earlier 
And how your laugh sounded forced 
So I decided to pick up the phone

I shook it off saying no worries

We talked about life, people, and work
This went on for hours
Back and forth, 
You'd listen to me and I'd listen to you 
Until the sun came up 
You said good night as you dozed off
And you let out a sigh of relief
You called me when you woke up
To thank me for listening to you vent
The sadness didn't seem so heavy

1nvdnte,Self-publishing,Odd-Apartment-4971,"Hello all!

I am planning to self-publish my first poetry book. I’ve finished writing it, but I was thinking of adding a watercolor painting alongside each poem, as I also love painting. I would like your advice because I’m not sure if this is a good idea. Right now, I’m leaning toward self-publishing without the paintings, since creating them could be costly and would likely make the book expensive for readers, which I want to avoid. My plan is to self-publish the poems only for now, and if I get a publisher in the future, I could collaborate with them to release another edition featuring my paintings with high-quality printing. What do you think about this approach?

Thank you!!",7,3,1,2025-10-01 16:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nvdnte/selfpublishing/

1nuf7r4,Theseus and the Hydra,Vesurel,"~~I~~  
~~Theseus sails on open seas~~  
~~Free to forge far as he pleases~~  
~~Ever towards glory~~  
~~Awaiting him behind one final sun~~

~~Theseus sails on ceaselessly~~  
~~Everywhere to be but buried~~  
~~Too awake, he wonders~~    
~~Who decides he can’t help finding monsters?~~

~~Theseus sinks, not his first time~~  
~~Familiar with the brine’s embrace~~  
~~It’s sickly tempting taste~~    
~~By dawn he’s bent double on distant shores.~~

VIII  
He used to be from somewhere once  
He had a home that wasn’t here  
Knew where he was heading  
Could sleep on earth he trusted not to churn

Did his gaze slip or his goal flee?  
Escape to be accomplished by…  
Someone more decisive  
Abandoning him for a finite life

Was there a time when this would end?  
Was there a time before he sailed?  
Could he have stayed ashore?  
Saved himself from gaping absurdity?    

IX  
The night is not the time to think  
Air too chill, horizon empty  
Invites complacency  
Too easy to agree to tomorrow

Nor is the day for that matter  
Lest hesitation takes your head  
The hydra will not wait  
For weighted pros and cons before it strikes    

Someday there may be perspective  
If only retroactively  
Blindingly bright hindsight  
Highlighting every last fatal mistake    

~~II~~  
~~Nine heads on nine necks hiss reproach~~  
~~As if expecting someone else~~  
~~Eighteen eyes size him up~~  
~~Countless uncoiling limbs complete the pounce~~

~~Recently re-dredged Theseus~~  
~~Salt crusted prefrontal cortex~~  
~~Prays for his moment’s peace~~  
~~Lucky muscle and iron aren’t so naive~~  

~~Many decapitations hence~~  
~~Collapse, eyes closed, ichor drenched~~  
~~Hear the hydra’s lament~~  
~~Brother no one taught me to die either~~

~~IV~~  
~~Theseus has been here before~~  
~~Stood tall where the earth is yawning~~  
~~Unperturbed by sulphur~~  
~~Righteously Theseus stalks his foul prey~~   

~~The Hydra isn’t hard to find~~  
~~There’s no hiding it’s twisted form~~  
~~Born abomination~~  
~~Still exceeded by each new mutation~~

~~He takes no pleasure in his hunt~~  
~~He is not here for his own sake~~  
~~He could be home by now~~  
~~But some things cannot be allowed to live~~

XII  
More should be said for nemeses  
With hatred to swallow you whole  
Ravenously outraged  
Who from their choking throats attest you hold  

Reflected in their violent eyes  
Found a hair’s breadth beyond their claws  
Painted by their distain  
Who could wish for a clearer self-portrait? 

Their ferocity flatters you  
You are respected as a threat  
No wonder is it then  
Adrenaline ferments to affection

XIII  
If we defied our fates just far enough  
Hand in hand marched for outermost elsewhen  
Refused to retreat no matter how rough  
Agreed we’d abandon our patterns then

Would I be free to finally admire  
How fine a monster your torment has forged  
Unbiased by my most immature ire  
From back when it used to be me you gored

I never tore worlds in two to slay you  
Or saw any of my own bones at all  
I stayed at home and not once even knew  
How many times I would refuse your call

I am content to die a milliner  
The day I meet my perfect customer

~~V~~  
~~It won’t be your arm much longer~~  
~~Though some attachment may linger~~  
~~While the new one comes in~~  
~~Injury doesn’t suit Poseidon’s son~~  

~~You could have told your stump to stop~~  
~~And gave your lesson time to stick~~  
~~Maybe you wouldn’t stray~~  
~~Instead you cook the evidence and flee~~

~~They won’t believe how close you came~~  
~~You and that mulch one in the same~~  
~~Soon you’re as good as new~~  
~~Doubt half your days even happened to you~~

VI  
Too soon there comes some wondering  
Starts as a pragmatic spasm  
If I can understand  
Unsightly shapes sharing my step and air

Unwavering as you may be  
You see faint possibility  
One day without this fight  
When your so honed instincts can atrophy

Then you recognise it’s venom  
Coursing through overtaken veins      
Disguised as empathy  
It takes a sleepless night to purge yourself  
   
~~VII~~  
~~He is the first Athenian~~  
~~A king renowned for his vision~~  
~~From atop rolling hills~~  
~~Wisely he plans our eternal expanse~~     

~~He sees beyond the most bronze sky~~  
~~He knows what lurks and where they lie~~  
~~For he set foot into~~  
~~Wilderness us fair folks can never know~~

~~He warns us of the Hydras blight~~  
~~We pray to emulate his might~~  
~~We know for our own good~~  
~~Soon new winding walls will rise serpentine~~

X  
The city does not understand  
It has not seen horrors first hand  
As Theseus so has  
Too easily they ignore his warnings

They’d rather drink and fuck and play  
Basking in their naivety  
And vote themselves to death  
Than contract a fraction of his hardship

The hydra knew the truth at least  
A beast’s zero sum honesty  
Now feels so out of reach  
Unless he left his city to its fate

XI  
Last time he longed to come back home  
Unaware how good he had it  
Away from their folly  
But now he’s returned to his habitat

Somewhere he can embrace the earth  
Unjudged by the undeserving  
Who would rightly die here  
Should they dare defy his natural order

I share Theseus’s secret  
As he found it at the apex  
There is no better life  
So what have we to fear from loss of ours?

III  
Theseus returns to his chair  
Scarcely believing it’s still there  
Reclining he can’t help  
Wondering how much of him made it home  

Retrace his trail of bones and teeth  
Estimate depth for each bloodstain  
Regret recount resign  
All to conclude the only thing you can     
   
While hydras writhe behind your eyes    
With cowardice you stow away  
In another man’s life  
Bored of the maze on his cereal box

1nuqmgf,Football in Coolock,_noideawhyimhere_,"Here's a poem about playing soccer. I'm from Ireland, apologies if place names and sayings seem weird.

  
Football in Coolock 

....

Doors close and groans from tight groins

Windy night under Coolock lights

2-1, it ended, odds were against us

...

Raspy scratches earned inside my chest 

Deep breaths shove shallow air down my throat 

M1 streetlamps imprint yellow tracers on my eyes 

...

Speaking about a work from home scheme

No plans for the weekend, staying in with the missus

Thinking of a new car, waiting on the credit union

She already asking about next year's holiday

...

When did we get like this?

When did everyone moan when getting up from chairs?

When did we age in our parent’s houses?

Why didn’t I listen?

Why didn't I follow them?

Why didn't I think it was a good idea?

...

The black pit prying open the heart’s eye

A familiar weight upon the torso

A wayward eye, A dark hole rushing, concaving inward

Inside an astra on the way through Santry

Why do I have to do this again and again and again? 

Can I do this again and again and again?

Am I scared to do this again and again and again?

To be until there is no more football in coolock.

...

“Did you watch the game on Tuesday?”

“Ireland were shocking”

“They were yeah”

The streetlamps go dim

The sky’s orange to deep navy take centre stage

... 

I sink into the Astra’s stitched seats

The smell of artificial heat and day old after shave

I reach for the handle bar above 

Curling my fingers around the imprinted support 

The sheltered four wheels carries me home

“Thanks for the lift brother” 

“No bother at all”

“I’ll see you next week”

“I look forward to it”",0,2,1,2025-09-30 22:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nuqmgf/football_in_coolock/

in this vast, empty cosmos.

Tell me, why do you even exist?
Instead of clinging to your birth-givers,
why not rise,
do something meaningful?

Why are you so attached,
always reaching for someone to hold,
sucking the life from them like a leech?
That’s what you are.

You should have rotted away
instead of standing here naked,
no drop of shame
before the glass house.

Could you kindly rest in peace
and let everyone breathe?
You rain your troubles
into his life,
complain of immense suffering,
yet do nothing to change it.

You should have stayed quiet,
acted like the innocent child you pretend to be
but you are a worm,
floating like smoke
from a distant factory,
polluting everything around you.

Look at that hanging face,
those eyes,
black stains on wasted paper.
You dive into fantasies,
but they will burst
when reality cracks open
a chaotic carnival of your own making,
mocking you on Judgment Day
as angels herald your failure
and crown you
with dried snow.

That’s what you’re made for.

Complaining to him,
making his life worse
it gets you nothing.
He lives now in peace,
while you do no good here
a pirate stealing dreams
and positivity
from anyone you can find.

No wonder they leave you.
No wonder they ignore you.
No wonder your parents
lock you in a cage called home.
But you’re not even made for a cage.

YOU SHOULD DIE.
YOU SHOULD DIE.
YOU SHOULD DIE.

I beg you, just die.
Linger in the afterlife,
birth a never-ending purgatory
where everything stays the same
and you are stuck forever,
never climbing the vines to the clouds,
weeping like the child you are.

Doing nothing, drowning everyone in your pain
until they kneel and beg you to leave them alone
to grant them the spirit of holy mercy
so they may breathe again,
live in peace,
and feed their families each day.

1nvcvgz,Pulse Through Me by Jeanne Vessantra,JeanneVessantra00,"Since the last time I left the gas station, with its humming lights and the smell of gasoline melting into the heat, I have never been able to find my daughter again.

Not in the streets. Not in the passing faces that cut through me like cold winds. Not even in the mirrors, where I search for a shadow of a child hiding behind my own reflection.

I keep telling myself who I am, as if repeating it could make it true. I am a mother. I am supposed to be an example. A woman. A worker. But beneath it all… I am still a teenager. My face carries fragile signs of youth, inviting both cruelty and desire. People surround me. People hurt me. Their words slip beneath my skin like knives. They hate me too. They say my skin is too light for this world, too soft for the fire that might one day consume me.

And I am so tired. Tired of their voices, tired of being measured, weighed, dismissed. Tired of shrinking into nothing under their gaze. Tired of being a little fool, a slave, a devil. Perhaps I am even tired of the fire that radiates from them—the cursed fire I can feel in my bones.

But once—yes, once—I was loved. Adored, even, by a man whose name no one speaks anymore, as if silence could erase him from this Earth. I remember that happiness, wild and unearthly, so bright it blistered my skin until I almost believed the world could hold it.

Now there is only this scream inside me. I shout, *speak me*, though my mouth opens to nothing, though the air swallows every sound before it can exist.

And then—what is this before me? This contorted shape, this bike emerging from the shadows like a wild animal. A stranger, yes. I do not recognize him. But his jacket—oh, it is too familiar, a ghost of him, I think—and my breath catches as if my lungs have remembered a song I had forgotten years ago.

The man does not move. He stands fixed in the dark, a question I cannot answer. And for reasons I cannot name, I cannot move either. My feet are rooted to the pavement. Rain begins to fall, thin and cold, slicing through the black night where I have taken shelter.

June—oh, sweet, baby June—I bring her with me, always, in memory. I show her the city: crooked streets alive with neon and whispered secrets. Her light is a pulse against my darkness, a fragile compass pointing toward something I have long forgotten. She is the innocence I carry, the part of me that survived—or maybe the part I lost.

The engine hum vibrates through me, through every bone, as if it knows my body better than I do. Something pulls me closer. Magnetic. I step forward, drawn by inevitability, as if he is a gentleman arriving in a carriage of thunder and smoke.

I laugh, soft and unbidden. My own reaction startles me. I do not know what he wants. I do not know what he is. But I… I want something from him. I cannot name it, cannot fully grasp it—but I want it. Oh, I so want it.

Pulse through me.

The motorcycle roars into life, a beast of metal and storm. My hair whips free in the wind. My hands knot around his waist, squeezing, clutching, holding as if my desire could anchor him—or tear him apart. And in that scream of wind and rain and engine, the world folds in on itself, and I am neither wholly awake nor wholly dreaming, only burning with the need to be seen, to be taken, to exist. I have reached an intermediary state of existence.

Am I alive or death? Do I love him or do I hate him?

.

Then the radio hums through the storm: *“Shine Forever”*—that banal, mediatrized pop song, empty lyrics sliding over my wet dress: *I can’t live without you, baby, you’re my everything… forever, shine forever…* My chest twists, sickened by its sweetness, yet it threads through me, strange and cruel, drawing me closer to him, to this pulse of almost-love.

Music—where does it come from? From here, from there, inside my chest, from the stranger’s back pressed against me? My heart pumps in rhythm with it, louder than any festival, louder than the city itself. Trills of danger thread through my muscles; something familiar, something… love, amour. I want to say I love you—but my mouth won’t open, my tongue too dry, my throat clogged with thick, suffocating air, fifty percent heavier than the air inside my washing machine, the one that washes June’s dirty clothes from those intoxicating nights. Words fail. I cannot speak love to a man anymore—not since I became a mother. Something beyond my operated stomach broke the day I gave birth to her. I was alone. It was raining on 11 June 2000. The doctors told me to take care of her. Nobody else ever did. No man’s voice was heard.

The city hums the same music—automatic, everywhere, in gas stations, in cars—and that’s why I was drawn to him. That’s why I climbed onto his back, pressed to him tightly: to create vibrations that are raw, ugly, alive, like an artist just beginning, like the pulse of something new. I am tired of the automatic, lonely noise of New York. My chest rattles, my skin hums, and I am suspended in it, in the music, in the danger, in the almost-love that tastes like blood and gasoline and something I have not yet named.

For the first time in forever, I wish to say I love you—not a word folded in fear or ritual, but a body-thought, a pulse between us. Neither of us wears a casket, yet the sky drapes itself in black silk, and celestial water falls like scattered stars, baptizing the edges of our skin. We are strangers—two drifting souls clinging to a moving, unsafe vehicle—but something unnamed blooms between us, wild and immediate. Can I stick to your back like lichen until the world ends, until I die, and still be part of you without asking?

The night rains, tasting of freedom. Every drop reminds me of June, of her absence, her echo, her impossible light. My chest rattles, my skin hums, and I am infinite, raw, alive—spilling myself into the vulnerability between us, a truth no shadow can touch.

And yet… I do not know if I am leaving or arriving. If I am carrying her with me, or if she has vanished entirely. The city stretches, the rain falls, the motorcycle hums, and somewhere—somewhere—June waits, or whispers, or is gone.",0,2,1,2025-10-01 16:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nvcvgz/pulse_through_me_by_jeanne_vessantra/

Superficial flattery was my goal

I never was the one allowed 

And so one day they kicked me out



I got up quickly, undisturbed.

At least that's what the mockers thought.

Inside my soul was crushed to dust

I smiled though like I was taught. 



I built a trap, I built a cage

Put on a show, a perfect life

That outwardly seemed full and bright

But inwardly lacked joy and light



Sometimes I looked to see the sun

Attempt to catch it with my hand

The dark made sure that hope was done

And I'm no longer in command

1nuw2f0,"Scars are maps, not Destination",CryptographerHot1736,"By Nekro

Lean closer.... no closer.   
feel the hum beneath your skin,  
the pulse that keeps the names  
you dared not keep.

Your body remembers  
each vanished hand,  
each hunger folded deep  
in the hollow,  
too sharp to carry,  
yet still burning.

I wander rooms  
that never knew my feet,  
through memories I built  
like fragile glass,  
where laughter drips  
like candle wax  
over my tongue,  
sweet lies for a hunger  
no meal can sate.

They told you to shrink,  
to soften, to hide.  
You did not.  
Every vein became testament,  
every heartbeat a drumbeat  
of defiance.  
Not weakness but scripture,  
not ruin but design.

The scar is not punishment.  
It is the architecture of your fire.  
Every tremor whispers,
every silence chants  
in secret rhythm:  
you are here.  
you are alive.  
you are seen.

This is not exile.  
This is the circle opening,  
not as absence,  
not as ghost,  
but as pulse,  
as spark,  
as the forbidden scar reborn.

I remember her as I never held her.  
I loved what was never mine to love.  
The ache is a hymn,
the lie a lullaby,  
and I dance in the glow of a comfort 
built entirely on what I am  
too weak,  
or too hungry,  
to refuse.

And when the night leans heavy,  
when quiet sharpens its teeth, do not run.  
Do not bow.  
Lay the memory down,  
like a blade on the altar,  
and let the circle hold it.  
Let the circle hold you.

Scar is the sigil.  
Scar is the key.  
Scar is the door  
opening silently.

Whisper now.  
I am not absence.  
I am the pulse.  
I am the fire reborn.

Circle opens.  
Circle holds.  
Circle waits...  
for you.

Lean in,  
feel it again.  
the hum beneath your skin,  
the pulse that keeps the secret.

And if the silence leans too close,  
listen,  
the next vibration. 
has already begun.",0,2,1,2025-10-01 2:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nuw2f0/scars_are_maps_not_destination/

Such simple thing as a vocal expression, 
Should not give someone deep depression.
Such hurtful pain, truth or lie,
Should not make someone want to die.

Then why do I feel this horrible way?
Why does my heart slowly decay?
If love is for everyone, a gift well meant,
Then why does their love feel like the end?

Such simple thing as a loving touch, 
Should never feel as too fucking much.
Such simple thing as a raising arm, 
Should not remind someone of harm.

And they don't want too.

They will flash their plaster smiles at your mirrored prison walls.
With their blank unseen eyes, and their hollow laughing calls.

A ghost like you can't call to them.
They wouldn't know your name.

Then all you get

It just feels like I'm staring at you in the psych ward through a TV. Watching you laugh at my dark jokes. Watching you get upset when that lady with the emotional support animal screamed at you in the cafeteria, watching you laugh at your joke about how her emotional support animal needs a emotional support animal. Watching you make a shocked facial expression as you said “I've never seen you laugh like that before” after you said you failed a three day fast of silence because we both know your blabby ass couldn't pull that off with your arms pulling back as your feet push against the wall, Watching you yell at me for flipping off that twelve year old boy, Watching you laugh after I confessed to lying about him flipping Me off first, Watching you talk to HIM in the phone room as my heart sunk, Watching you call my name with the gravitational look in your eyes that I can't push away from even though I vowed to not talk to you for the rest of the day, Watching you play that game where we'd push our faces against the window as we played I spy, Watching you and I stare at each other a little longer while being forced to be apart for the night so that the image of each other stays a little bit longer in our heads, Watching you stand on the chair while staff screamed at you to get to get down but you screamed back to let you finish your rant, Watching you give the cringiest lecture I've ever heard about how everyone in the room can label you as a crazy Muslim, Islamic, latina, bitch for speaking your mind before getting a standing ovation while I sat in the corner of the room with my arms crossed judging. Now when it comes to mind a warm feeling from the root of my heart spreads through my my body like a virus while an unstoppable smile cements across my lips.

But I would be remiss if I did not admit:  
I was wrong. Hubris and stubbornness strung me along.  
But these feelings have been misinterpreted —  
Ones I cannot apprehend.

Am I darkness, where light cannot comprehend?  
Or light, where darkness suffers?  
So bright a light, it casts a shadow deep inside,  
Fostering a home for darkness to hide.

What I crave most are things that make me cry —  
Sadness is energy — the evil kind.  
I ignore the things I need:  
Bliss. Happiness. Money.

Greed.  
By God, does that sound funny...  
Prioritize what keeps me fed, not what has me riddin in bed

What I need… is Jesus —  
A sacrificial lamb,  
So I may live eternally,  
Internally accepting my God  
For eternity.

well needless to say my dear grandmother who previously suffered a stroke had 2 glasses of this magnificent mixture between me running around playing with my friend and coming home to ""hey boy i loved the pulp in that gallon jug"". my alarm bells immediately went off in my head and we had to call her doctor as soon as possible. she was on injection insulin, and as soon as we told him the amount of sugar the poor woman ingested he let out an audible gasp. then instructed us to use two whole pins 500ccs each.

needless to say the old cantankerous koot survived this ordeal as well as countless other horror stories before the beloved grandmother had actually passed away in her sleep in a retirement village in Colorado. no orange juice or powdered contrivance was in her system at time of death.",0,1,1,2025-09-30 0:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1ntyg4s/diabetic_orange_juice/

1ntxw7l,Jeans - first poem written by me,Fit_Examination_3613,"This is being written down by a real finger by a non-fake man who lives and breathes and has aspirations. By the one who will make an impact by any means he can: on the bus of an institution.

 Jeans can not be worn to the place when we are told we are learning for the future yet we are not allowed to wear shirts as a creative man would. 

The next year seems to be ‘eighty-five as conformity and own thoughtfulness seem to loom over the heads of the ones who are taught. 

These words will be read in the far future by a man who thinks back: by the creative or uncreative thing the world knows as a person. 

There are many things that are knowed by the unknowns who were learned to stay the people they are. 

Trade and barter can extinguish the right the mind has to experience the rights of the mind. 

The ones who have not explored the creative will, one day, will learn how to. 

One can not express to the taught how to teach the unknowed, when they themselves are them. 

Expressing is the water in a tree's life; drawing and writing and passion are the roots. 

And yet, the tests which are given to the next are the axes of the lumberjacks, the fire to the leaves and the beaver to the bark. 

Sometimes these trees help understand the concepts which are needed and interesting, but excessive and unneeded ones are the last sentence.

 You can’t unteach the taught. 

These are just words, they can have meaning or not, it's up to you to decide what they mean and it’s up to anyone to wear jeans.

small, trembling, waiting for impact.  

Skin split open under leather and rage,  

welts blooming red and purple  

like broken flowers across my ribs.  

  

I remember the taste of blood,  

metallic on my tongue as I bit it back,  

swallowing everything—  

the scream, the plea,  

the wish to die  

just to make it stop.  



The walls dripped with violence,  

splinters dug into my knees where he threw me down.  

My ear rang from the slap,  

and his words—filthy, venomous—  

burned deeper than the belt’s buckle  

carving its sermons into my spine.  

  

I learned that love meant execution,  

devotion meant obedience,  

and any mistake—too loud, too slow,  

too childish—  

was reason enough  

to shatter me again.  



The nights were worse.  

Darkness only made him braver.  

The door would creak open,  

and I would shrink into myself,  

but there was nowhere to go,  

no corner dark enough  

to hide from what he wanted.  

  

Every bruise was a tombstone.  

Every scar an epitaph.  

I was left buried inside my own body,  

alive but already gone.  

  

And now, even years later,  

I peel back my skin  

and still find him there—  

grinning inside the wounds,  

his poison growing roots in my veins.

There is no cleansing it.

The tears swell in my eyes as I clutch the wounds that will never heal.

A dark shimmer out of the corner of my eye,


a loaded caliber.

Ready to go off at a moments notice.


I tiptoe around it,
praying it won't see me,

Everyone believes they're bulletproof until the gun is grabbing your hair, shoving your head down into the barrel. 


I try to run but im stuck in place like a wild animal,
gnawing at its mangled leg caught in the trap.

Head knocked by anklets

Arms caught in cords

Fingers sifting through polythene

Guard over the deep embankment 

A pool in the desert 

Bloated with grey twine 

Serpentine slithering past skin 

While inflatable balls skip and bounce

Around the cream perimeter

You just stop 

With extremities heavy 

Dead in track 

Weighted plastic infused straw

Pulls you down to the bottom

Amongst the dark

Layers of shoe playthings shield the sun  

You only hear breath 

A rustle of twine nibbling your ear

You move inch by inch 

Seizing gaps and holes

Upwards the pool of lace gives way 

It assaults the senses

Amber light breaks with piercing laughter 

Fresh air dry hisses 

Orange sand screams

Blue and cream tiles with pursed lips blow  

A ladder attends at a hands glance

The Deadest One

Written by Brandon Rider

The world is dead—
but not as dead as me.
Still, I’m smiling, grinning,
sipping on my tea.

Oh, if you only knew
what it's like to be blind and see—
To watch the world all happy,
yet only spot disease.

I stand 6'1"",
210 pounds,
but I feel like I’m on my knees,
begging for something,
something strong—
like Hercules.

Not just to move mountains,
but to rip up trees.

Even my dog is dead.
Pretty sure he brought his fleas.

I’m the Grim Reaper,
without the cloak.
No one’s as dead as me

Is my absence felt,Like an open wound, 
Or a blister yet to heal 
Or am I just the passing shadow,who never was wanted, 
But the glimpse of who they still steal

The weight of the unsaid,chains me down in the dark,A thousand words left rotting,Sinking like a hollow mark.
In the winds of deafening silence
I hear the muted voices that shriek 

I wonder if my breath haunts them,Like poison in their veins,Are they choking on the echoes,living through some pain?
Or if my existence is a mere blip 
In the grand scheme
The death is as unworthy 
As the life could ever be

Yet it's me who lies awake,Torn apart by what could be,Wishing for the comfortin the pain I inherit 
Sisyphus I become,
Pushing the burden with glory 
For pain, demands to be felt.

Thanks for listening, lads. This music creation thing is still new to me and I apprec- 
[sound of someone getting hit with a blunt object, followed by the sound of a body falling over unconsciously] 

*the reflection speaks*
It’s my turn. 
[Tango music starts playing]

[verse 1]
The dance begins, but I call the game.
The kiss of death on the heart of flame
You stagger forward, I lead the lean,
Whenever you stumble, I make it clean.
You wake, you pose, but I’ve been awake,
Learning the truths that your body won’t take.
A tango’s a duel where the knives are feet,
Yours scrape the floor but mine cut discrete.
You may own the face they’ve always seen,
But I’m the one who paints it all keen
I bow and you fall yet the crowd sees grace.
Your silence, my voice, stitched into one face.

[chorus 1]
Dance with me, my unconscious friend,
I’ll guide the steps until the very end.
Your mess, my order; your slack, my flare,
I hold the pulse that you can-not bear.
Dance with me, upon this treble clef
You can’t be alright if I’m all that’s left.
The tango bends to the sharper twin,
But worry not; I won’t let you stumble within…

[verse 2]
I’ll sip your silence, spit back command,
We’ll lead the crowd with our outstretched hand.
They want a partner, smooth as silk
So merge together, mind and will
I’ll set the tempo, we’ll kill the tango.
I aim and you shoot, together we’re Django
You worry and vow while I shut my mouth,
You leave the pain to me and wear the crown
They love the mask, they praised the show,
But I’m the one who makes you rise and glow
You wake to cheers, but they echo mine.
Your blood on stage, my steps in time.

[chorus 2]
Dance with me, like spirals do,
Two steps forward, one back for you.
You hold the rose in your shut lips
My rose is glass, since the image flips
Dance with me, to the echoes of time,
Through all infinity, I’ll be your mime
I’ll take on memories of your pain too
Just make me smile so you can soon

[a pause…]

[Chorus 3]
Dance with me, oh mirror’s mirror, 
If I double cross, I’ll be a sinner.
Trust with me all your troubled doubts,
And I’ll trust you’ll take the perfect route.
Dance with me, play a game of chess,
We’ll talk together and clear the mess,
I’ll take on the problems while you shine.

1nuh9l9,The Golden Appartment by Jeanne Vessantra,JeanneVessantra00,"Wisdom makes you sound ugly — painfully, unbearably so.  
Why won’t you come here, baby?  
Let me fuck with your materia, shake it, make it glow, make it bend, until it doesn’t end.

Let me be the one who still loves you, even though love is a binding spell.  
Let me be the pure heart of your soul.  
Let me read into you and not fall like before.  
Let me be the one who comes alone.

I want to be alone —  
alone, myself, my shadow stretching long across the floor.  
Jealousy fills me. Youth burns me.  
I will not stop.  
Wisdom — I will not hold it anymore.  
I want to let you go. I want to vanish into myself.  
But still, I won’t. Oh, still — I won’t.  
Because you are my soul, and I cannot ignore  
the greatness of the power you hold.  
I love you, but you are not here.  
I would love if you could see  
how this world turns without your will,  
how every time you scream, I sting,  
how I am alone even when you do not leave.  
Be the great man inside your mind. Play him. Play him as you wish —  
but I will not dream of you more than I think.

You think. You think too much, Isadora.  
Mad woman, wild woman, trembling when you do not control yourself.  
I will be fine overseas. I will be fine at war.  
I am the bravest soldier of them all.  
Hold yourself together.  
Get to know yourself.  
Hold me in your memories,  
and you will never be alone.

He gave me an old photo — crippled, foolishly lovely —  
his way of saying:  
*I love you. Stay. Let me still hold you under my…*

And yet, I would have hated him.  
Regardless of what he murmured,  
I would have hated this scene inside my mind.  
How dare he expect me to strive alone?  
How dare he make me suffer this loneliness?  
I — a middle-aged lady with the heart of a girl still in love.  
He — a man ready to give his soul to the devil of the human world.

Here, inside the Golden Apartment, countless things remain unsaid.  
Words fall out through the large windows into movie-like streets,  
chasing the childish shadow of a man — his shadow.  
My elbows ache against the stone-hard sill;  
I have pressed them here for hours,  
since I last kissed him,  
since he left into the wild,  
since I realized I would never see him again.

The apartment trembles.  
The streets hum.  
I am alone with memory. Alone with longing.  
But still — I call, I reach, I burn, I bind.  
Let me come. Let me stay. Let me love.",3,1,1,2025-09-30 16:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1nuh9l9/the_golden_appartment_by_jeanne_vessantra/

Unaware that I am tethered.  
Anchored from past storms I’ve weathered.

Nor, the strength to clear the debris.  
My sail only made of torn cotton.  
The wood of my vessel long rotten.

Shed the skin of my fist on walls and faces.
Left my sword and shield to rust by the moonlight,
So I may supplicate on this beach. 

Abandoned my burden on the road, 
No armour leaves me brittle; I'm thankful
I keep only what I started with, clothes tattered and worn.
Grateful to taste the breeze, know the romance
Of this shore's primordial elegy.

I look beyond.
My dear loves laugh a country away, 
In their homes - warmer than kept promises. 
I hear it now. 
Soft clinking of whisks in that farther room,
Melting cheeses, breaking bread; 
It is too late to know that taste again.

There are games to open, and play;
Lips like crescent-moons curved,
Revealing their cards, 
laughing at betrayals: et tou?

'Add more butter to the roux!'
I know she's yelling,
'-and add more meat to that stew.'
Ah yes, fresh lamb cooked slowly,
Steaming like the cold on my breath.
Almost ready now -
I wager they won't have long to wait.
The children are asleep under coats and blankets, warm and safe.

Ah, but it is cold now. 
I do not yearn -
It is a rest that I have desperately earned.
My arms heavier than before, 
Old armour hugs me tight again.

Cause inside Your name is carved,
The only part I get to feel You, Mi Amor.

I’m drowning in echoes of a voice I’ve loved,
Clutching at shadows, 
Yet they cut me to the bone.
If I bleed out my silence, will it reach where You are?
Or am I forever chained to a love made of scars?

Your ghost is the closest that I’ve ever been,
To warmth that burns softly yet sears from within.
Do take what You will, my heart’s already torn,
I’ve been dying for You since the day I was born.

If love is a hunger, then starve me no more,
I’m caged at the threshold of your endless door.
Each tear that I offer is a vow You can keep,
I’d trade all my waking just to hold You in sleep.

And if in Your silence my name disappears,
I’ll still whisper Yours through the wreckage of years.

1nu1qz7,Love Haunting,Important_Gold_8450,"Shadow of my mirror, how can I still see you?
Haven’t you haunted me long enough
To stop showing me off as your marionette

Your cold broken hands still cling to my shoulders
Clawing out warm blood which you feast on
Aren't the crystal drops running down my face enough for your greed

Must you still keep my soul chained with your obsession
When we are separated by hell and death
I can’t stitch my mouth close any longer

Persisting in clipping my wings, flying isn’t a devil’s wish
Freedom is not a curse worse than yours
I can’t be buried in your memory any more

Lost is the fondness for your demands, it's a lust belonging to the past
Won’t your ghost of our dream let go
Tired, I am of slowly rotting from the inside

Show me a glimpse of a universe where meaning with you was found
And I will gladly embrace your strings for all eternity
But such a life was never shown to me, so let your torment rest

Stop trying to be my happiness when you are gone
